## Workshop Description

Bayesian statistical methods enable ...

## Install RevBayes & Accessory Programs

This workshop will use the most recent version of RevBayes. It can be downloaded for Windows 7 or higher or for Mac OSX 10.6 or higher from [https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes/releases](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes/releases). For Unix systems, you can clone the source code from [https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes).

The RevBayes workshops will also use additional for analysis of output and summarization of the MCMC. Please download and install the following:

* Tracer ([http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/))
* FigTree ([http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/))
* IcyTree (a web-based tree viewer; [http://tgvaughan.github.io/icytree/](http://tgvaughan.github.io/icytree))
* Text editors: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io)

## Recommended Background Material

### Tutorials

This workshop covers phylogenetic analysis under complex statistical models. Because of the challenging material, workshop participants will benefit from working through introductory material before taking the course. This is particularly true for anyone without a previous introduction to Bayesian phylogenetics.
